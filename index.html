<!-- Fourth section for lists -->

    <h2>@lists</h2>
    <h3>Okay, so lists are self explinatory. Here, we will see how we can create different types of lists</h3>


    <h3>unordered list</h3>
    <p>The unordered lists are created using (&lt; ul &gt;) tag and inside that we write (&lt; li &gt;) tag for list items.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Something</li>
        <li>Something else</li>
        <li>Sgain something else</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>unorderes inline list</h3>
    <p>So instead of going to a new row each time we create a inline unordered list.but for this we will have to use a little bit of CSS</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Something in inline unordered list</li>
        <li>Something else in inline unordered list</li>
        <li>Sgain something else in inline unordered list</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>ordered list (Reversed) </h3>
    <p>Now the final type is ordered list and how do you create that? using using (&lt; ol &gt;) tag and rest of the process is same as above</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Mobile</li>
        <li>Computer</li>
        <li>Laptop</li>
    </ol>
